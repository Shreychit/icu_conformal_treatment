# 5. Discussion

Our results show that a simple combination of T-learner models and conformal prediction can yield ICU treatment policies that are both **selective** and **calibrated**, in the sense that they provide explicit abstentions when the evidence is ambiguous and achieve near-nominal coverage for the underlying risks. On synthetic data with known potential outcomes, the dominance-based policy behaves as expected: it either chooses the truly better arm or abstains, leading to essentially zero regret among decided patients. This gives a strong sanity check that the conformal construction and dominance rule are mathematically sound when model assumptions are satisfied.

On the MIMIC-IV v3 ICU cohort, the empirical picture is more nuanced and clinically interesting. A logistic T-learner, trained on a relatively simple set of demographic and administrative features, attains moderate-to-good discrimination for in-hospital mortality and, when wrapped in the conformal dominance policy, can issue recommendations for roughly three quarters of ICU stays at a reasonable miscoverage level (e.g., \(\alpha = 0.20\)). At this operating point, the policy maintains high empirical coverage and zero model-based regret among decided patients. This suggests that, even with modest models, one can construct decision rules that are both actionable and conservative: they act when the model is both confident and calibrated, and they abstain otherwise.

Comparing logistic regression to XGBoost highlights an important lesson: **higher AUROC does not necessarily translate into a more useful abstaining policy**. The XGBoost T-learner attains better discrimination but produces substantially wider and more overlapping conformal intervals, so the dominance condition is rarely satisfied. As a result, the XGBoost-based policy is extremely conservative, abstaining on nearly all patients for \(\alpha \le 0.10\) and on almost all patients even at \(\alpha = 0.20\). This trade-off between discrimination and **dominance-based actionability** underscores that model evaluation for decision support should go beyond standard metrics and consider how often, and for whom, the model can confidently recommend one treatment over another.

The subgroup analyses provide further insight into how the policy behaves across patient populations and care environments. Along the age dimension, we see a clear monotone pattern: younger patients enjoy higher coverage but also higher abstention rates, while older patients experience lower coverage and fewer abstentions. One interpretation is that, under the fitted model, the risk profiles of older patients are more clearly separated between emergent and non-emergent admission pathways, leading to more frequent dominance of one arm. At the same time, the lower coverage suggests that the conformal intervals may be miscalibrated in this high-risk region, possibly due to limited sample size, residual confounding, or missing covariates.

By contrast, policy behaviour across gender is remarkably similar: both decision rates and coverage are closely matched between female and male patients, with zero regret among decided cases in both groups. This is encouraging from a basic fairness perspective, although it does not constitute a full fairness analysis. Including gender as a pre-treatment covariate is statistically natural, as it may act as a confounder, but it also necessitates transparent reporting of subgroup performance. Our analysis here is descriptive: we measure how the learned policy behaves across genders rather than enforcing any particular fairness criterion.

The most heterogeneous behaviour appears across ICU careunits. Some units, such as Cardiac Vascular ICU and Neuro Intermediate, operate in a highly conservative regime: coverage is very high, but the policy abstains frequently. Others, such as the Neuro Surgical ICU, exhibit low coverage and few abstentions, indicating an aggressive and potentially miscalibrated regime. Mixed medical–surgical ICUs sit between these extremes. These patterns suggest that a single global choice of miscoverage level \(\alpha\) may not be appropriate across all care settings; careunit-specific tuning, or at least stratified reporting and possibly unit-specific policies, may be necessary for deployment.

## 6. Limitations and future work

This study has several limitations. First, the clinical application is based on **observational data** from a single ICU database. While we adopt a potential-outcomes framing and include standard pre-treatment covariates, we do not claim that our estimates of \(r_0(x)\), \(r_1(x)\), or the induced policies are causally identified. Unmeasured confounding, selection bias, and time-varying treatment patterns are all plausible in MIMIC-IV v3. The pseudo-regret metrics we report are therefore best interpreted as internal consistency checks rather than causal guarantees.

Second, our implementation deliberately uses **simple feature engineering and baseline models**. We focus on understanding the behaviour of the conformal dominance policy, not on maximising predictive performance. More expressive architectures (e.g., recurrent or transformer-based models over the full ICU time series) and richer covariate sets may change both the quality of risk estimates and the structure of conformal intervals. Exploring how the abstain/decide trade-off behaves with such models is an important direction for future work.

Third, we study a single binary outcome (in-hospital mortality) and a coarse binary treatment (emergent vs non-emergent admission). Real ICU decisions are multi-stage and multi-dimensional, involving sequences of treatments and competing outcomes (e.g., mortality, length of stay, quality of life). Extending conformal treatment policies to multi-arm or sequential decision problems is non-trivial but would increase clinical relevance.

Fourth, we evaluate on a single dataset from a single health system. External validation on independent cohorts, as well as robustness checks across hospitals and time periods, would be necessary before any real-world deployment. Similarly, we report subgroup behaviour along age, gender, and careunit, but do not exhaustively investigate fairness across all protected attributes or intersectional groups.

Finally, even a perfectly calibrated and selective policy is not, by itself, a decision-maker. In practice, such a system would need to be integrated into clinical workflows, with careful user-interface design, prospective validation, and ongoing monitoring. Our experiments should be viewed as a methodological proof-of-concept: they show that it is possible to construct ICU treatment policies that come with finite-sample uncertainty guarantees and explicit abstentions. Bridging the gap from this proof-of-concept to a deployed system will require close collaboration with clinicians, health-system stakeholders, and ethicists.

Despite these limitations, we believe that dominance-based conformal treatment policies occupy a useful middle ground between pure prediction and fully automated decision-making. They provide a principled way to say “we are confident enough to recommend action A over action B” and, equally importantly, to say “we are not confident enough to decide,” which is a crucial capability in high-stakes clinical settings.
