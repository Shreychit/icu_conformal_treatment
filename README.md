# ICU Conformal Treatment Project

Goal: Regret-bounded individualized treatment decisions in ICU using conformal counterfactual inference.

Structure:
- src/icu_conformal_treatment: Python package with core code (data, models, conformal, policy).
- notebooks: Exploration, EDA, preliminary experiments.
- data/raw: Raw ICU data (e.g., MIMIC-IV).
- data/processed: Cleaned and feature-engineered datasets.
- configs: YAML configs for experiments.
- scripts: CLI utilities for preprocessing and running experiments.
